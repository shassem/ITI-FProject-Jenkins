This project is based on an infrastructure repository: https://github.com/shassem/ITI-FinalProject-Infrastructure


## Illustrations & Setup

### Jenkins Credentials Configurations:
- Create a credential for your Dockerhub account.
- Secret file credentials that contains the VM service account key pair file in order to have access to the cluster.

### Dockerfile

Created a Dockerfile to dockerize my python app on my local machine.
```bash
    docker build -t shassem/hellopython .
    docker push shassem/hellopython
```
### Jenkinsfile

Created a Jenkinsfile with continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) stages.

#### CI stage:

- Building the image with a version number equals to the Jenkins build number. 
- Passing the Dockerhub credentials in order to login.
- Pushing the new image to Dockerhub.

BUILD_NUMBER is an environment variable.

#### CD stage:

- Passing the service account credentials to connect to the cluster.
- Replacing the "tag" in the deployment file with the new BUILD_NUMBER (version).
- Deploying the app with kubectl.

When the pipeline finishes building, the app will be deployed on the GKE cluster based on this repository:
